⚠️ Areas to Strengthen
Quantify Impact

-Add metrics such as “reduced report generation time by 80%,” “improved forecast accuracy to X%,” or “enabled data-driven decisions for a €Y M portfolio.”
-Concrete numbers help me gauge ROI of your work.

Documentation & Collaboration

-Link to a GitHub repo or a README that walks through your M-code, DAX snippets and forecasting notebook.
-Demonstrates version control, clear documentation, and ease of hand-off to teammates.

Performance & Scale

-If you’ve tested incremental refresh on >1 M rows or optimized query performance, call it out.
-Shows you can handle enterprise-scale datasets, not just toy examples.

Business Storytelling

-   Include a slide or narrative that ties your insights back to decisions: e.g., 
    “Based on the forecast, the team increased production of Antibiotics by 15% in Q3 to meet projected demand.”
-Reinforces the “so what?” of your analysis.

Model Governance

-Briefly mention how you’d monitor model drift, retrain your forecasting pipeline, or manage versioning in Azure ML.
-Signals an awareness of ML lifecycle beyond a one-off notebook.
